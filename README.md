# Ef6BookApp

This was built to compare the performance of EF6 against EF Core for the 
application called the "book app" as created in the book 
[Entity Framework Core in Action](http://bit.ly/2m8KRAZ).

**NOTE:** it relies on a database that is built by the Chapter13-Part1 branch of the
[EfCoreInAction](https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCoreInAction) appilcation.
Without this it will FAIL.
